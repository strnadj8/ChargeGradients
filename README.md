# ChargeGradients
This program simulates a charge running through a circuit by way of charge gradients. The charge flows from higher concentration to lower
concentration until the halfway point, at which the charges are flipped and the opposite is true.

This program was written in Python 3.2.2 using the graphics module VPython. VPython can be installed using the following links:

Windows: http://vpython.org/contents/download_windows.html

Mac: http://vpython.org/contents/download_mac.html

Upon launching the program, you will see the circuit in one window and the Python Shell in another. The shell will prompt you to enter a
type of charge. Upon doing so, you will see the charge run through the circuit. You will also see an additional window which will graph the
velocity of the charge running through the circuit against time.
